Air Quality Monitoring System

🔍 Real-Time AQI Tracking | 🌱 Agriculture Impact Analysis | 📊 Interactive Dashboards

This project is an Air Quality Monitoring System designed to track, analyze, and visualize the Air Quality Index (AQI) of any Indian city in real time. The system integrates live API data, interactive visualizations, and agriculture-specific recommendations, making it an end-to-end tool for environmental awareness and decision-making.

🚀 Project Overview

The system uses data from reliable APIs to fetch real-time AQI values along with major pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, SO₂, CO, and O₃. Users can search for a city, view the current AQI, analyze trends, and understand how pollution levels impact human health and crop productivity.

Additionally, the project includes:

📉 Past AQI data visualization (graphs for last 10 days)

🗺️ India heatmap showing pollution levels state-wise

🤖 AI-based recommendations for safety and agriculture

💡 User-friendly GUI built using CustomTkinter

🧠 Backend integration for seamless data flow


🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

CustomTkinter for GUI

Matplotlib for AQI charts

Pandas for data analysis

Requests API for live AQI data

Geo APIs for city coordinates


🎯 Objective

The goal is to create an accessible, efficient, and visually appealing tool that helps individuals, farmers, and researchers understand air pollution levels and take informed actions.
